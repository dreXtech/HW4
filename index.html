  <p> Our annual food drive takes place this month.This event is the largest one-day food drive 
      in the metropolitan area and has helped feed those in need since 1991. We strive to provide 
      the most nutritious food for individuals and families in our community. If you
      are unable to bring items to the food bank at 2828 N. Central Avenue in Phoenix, please consider
      a cash donation. For every doller you donate, our food bank buy $12 worth of food using wholesale
      discount. Please mail donations to:  2828 N. Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85000. Our success depends
      on the time and caring of our donors and volunteers so thank you all!</p>
